# SatSimulator: EventSat
 In the context of an increasing number of space objects and the necessity of tracking these due to the higher and higher risk of collisions among them, various types of surveillance systems have been developed, most of them relying on ground-based technology. In spite of receiving enhancements that make them more precise, they still have some limitations and cannot detect space objects smaller than a ball of 10 centimeters in diameter. In order to surpass these limitations, some on-orbit tracking systems are under development, including the focus of this project’s thesis: the EventSat project. It is originated within the Technical University of Munich's EventSat project: https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/sps/eventsat-mission. 
 
 The aim of this project is the development of a satellite simulator that incorporates an event sensor camera.
